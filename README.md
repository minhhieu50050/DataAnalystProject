To understand more about Hopitality Domain, we have to caculate the metric formulas like:
- Revenue : To get the total revenue_realized
- RevPar : Revenue Per Available Room , RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied
- DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights): This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period
- Occupancy: Occupancy means total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available(capacity)
- ADR(Average Daily rate): It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. 
- Realisation: It is nothing but the succesful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened.
